# NBA2K Player Rating Prediction using Machine Learning

The goal of this project was to find a relationship between player season stats and their 2K ratings. We know that 2K sports 
is using some algorithm to compute 2K ratings but we wanted to know more in depth of what this relationship. Our final project report 
showcases some our findings and interesting conclusions from the experiments we performed
